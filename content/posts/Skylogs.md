Skylogs was a project I developed after getting my skydiving certification. Built with Expo and React Native for both Android and iOS.

Skylogs is a digital logbook for skydivers where jumps can be documented. Location, date, height, free fall time, equipment and other details can be stored. It also supports other divers to sign your jump to make it official. Also, users may analize personal stats like how long have you fallen, for how many feet, favorite equipment, how many emergency deploys have been made and personal license.

I built skylogs using React Native, Redux and SQLite so it was a standalone app, no APIs beside google where being called to, all user information was stored locally. This app was quite the challenge, I hadn't designed nor built any apps before, so it took my a while to finish it. I thought I had learned everything I needed in the courses I took before building it, but the truth is, most of my learning came from building an actual project.

Skylogs was my first published app, I later sold it to a skydiving site so I could focus on the next challenge.
