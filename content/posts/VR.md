I took a C++ course for game development around May, partly because I wanted to learn C++ for Internet of Things and also because I've been always amazed by the gaming industry and the amount of complexity and dedication put into games. That course made me realize I was really into 3D designing, and I was pretty good at it because I did it in college for my Mechanical Engineering Degree. 

I started to mess around with a 3D modeling software called *Blender* and *Unreal Engine*, one of the top game developing softwares. I later found a software also developed by Epic Games called *Twinmotion* where you could upload an architecture file and add textures and objects to make it more realistic. It was very fun to use, so I started talking with architects I knew and somehow managed to sell a VR project for a small apartment building.

The process was pretty complex, 
- First I had to upload the architect's design to Twinmotion and add all sorts of textures, furniture, vegetation and decoration to the scene. 
- After the scene was completed, I transfered the project from Twinmotion to Unreal Engine/.
- But before doing anything in Unreal, I exported the scene to Blender, where I "fixed" details of all objects to make them look good in Unreal, and also to be able to 3D print the whole scene.
- I imported the modified file back to Unreal Engine, and added the logic and components to make the scene VR playable.
- Finally, I tweaked the settings around to make the project deployable to Oculus Quest 2 so it could be played as a game without having to be connected to a computer.

The hardest part of this process was debugging and getting to a product that could run smoothly, packaging a game takes a long time and sometimes compiling errors were really hard to solve. But I managed to deliver the project on schedule and eventually sold a second bigger project to another architecture firm.
