SIWA was a project I developed after getting my skydiving certification. Built with Expo and React Native for both Android and iOS.

SIWA is a digital logbook for skydivers where jumps can be documented. Location, date, height, free fall time, equipment and other details can be stored. It also supports other divers to sign your jump to make it official. Also, users may analize personal stats like how long have you fallen, for how many feet, favorite equipment, how many emergency deploys have been made and personal license.

SIWA was my first published app, I later sold IT to a skydiving site so I could focus on the next challenge.
