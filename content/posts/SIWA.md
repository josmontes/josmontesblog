description: "A hotel management solution from the ground up."

I joined KMND in november of 2021. KMND is a software developing company. My first assignment was to interview the client, design a fullstack solution for him, negotiate budget and implement it.

As a developer, I found out I needed to improve my people skills as much as my programming skills, so this challenge was a great opportunity for this. The client is currently building an apartment complex called SIWA in a Mexican beach, but he wanted to be able to manage it as a hotel, not only this, but he also wanted to be able to syncronize calendars with all the available booking platforms like *Airbnb* and *Booking.com*. Users also had to be able to schedule appointments for all of the complex ammenities like spa, restaurants and activities.

After talking with the client, I designed a complete solution, including Backend, Admin Panel, Client WebApp and Apartment Owner App. I set a budget acording to the company's resources and succesfully negotiated with the client to reach an agreement and the budget got accepted.

For this solution, I used NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, React and React Native. This time, the backend had to be a bit more complex since it had to automatically sync with other platforms at specific time intervals, so I had to implement a job scheduler library called node-cron, to execute syncs at a set time intervals.

I really enjoyed working directly with the client because he only had a vague idea of what he needed, so we worked together to assemble a solution for a problem that was not completely clear at the beginning. I managed to create a friendly and trusting relationship with the client so he would continue to hire the company for future projects.
