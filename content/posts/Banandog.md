description: "Ba単andog was my first fullstack project. A whole e-commerce solution for a pet spa."
---
Ba単andog was my first project sold before building as a freelancer developer. It consisted of a fullstack solution for a mobile pet spa, including backend, admin panel, employee app and client app.

Ba単andog is a mobile pet spa. Before the app, people had to call or contact via facebook or whatsapp and schedule an appointment, so a mobile spa could come to your house and groom your pet. The project had to cover the following requirements: Users could schedule and pay in advance for an appointment for 1 or 2 pets. They could also browse the store and buy any product that could be delivered on the day of the appointment. Employees had to be able to see their respective schedule of the day, and get the address of the appointments they had to go to. The admin panel had all of the above requirements, plus they could also manage all the information of the whole project, including client and employee data, and update store products as well as services.

This project was insanely challenging, It took me about 6 or 7 months to complete everything, I sold this project after finishing a FullStack course, but taking it to a professional level was a whole other lever of difficulty. I learned a lot. For the backend, I used NodeJS, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL, I'm very proud of having managed to actually make a custom authorization middleware that could separate permissions on the different processes based on the user clearance. For the frontend, I used React and React Native, this time though, I  heavily relied on hooks combined with redux state to keep a more scalable and efficient structure of the project. Shoutout to my friend Rodrigo for helping me with the AWS architecture.
