Tricomx is a telecommunications startup I helped build since day one, My knowledge skyocketed with them.

Tricomx is a relatively new telecommunications company, I started working with them because I knew one of the founders so he offered me a job. Because of them I started my developing career. My first task was to learn and develop their first website. I built it using basic html, css, and javascript. After that, the challenges kept growing in complexity and difficulty. A few months after deploying the website, I was tasked with developing part of the system using PHP, so I had to learn about that too. Eventually we stumbled upon the world of SPAs and that's where I started to flourish. I learned React and React Native and built the whole family of applications for the company including the client mobile app, simple e-commerce platform, admin panel, enterprise web app, and a lot more.

As I progressed in my career and knowledge, my impact in the company also grew larger. I was assigned a team of 3 developers (including myself). We were tasked with reestructring the whole backend system to be managed as microservices and to build upon the current frontend apps. Our team successfully implemented a solution to take advantage of the AWS ecosystem and of all the resources we had. For this challenge, I learned AngularJS because we decided as a team that AngularJS was a better fit for the admin panel than React.
