I'm Jos Montes, I learned to program on my own. I'm always learning about new technologies and taking on new challenges. If you'd like to chat or work together, don't hesitate to call me.

This site is a work in progress, I made it to share my projects and to hold me accountable and force me to continue building, thanks for visiting!
